We have certain expectations for how members of the communities who have been distinguished with roles behave in the server. If you feel these expectations are not being met, we'd love if you could let us know by posting in #reactiflux-moderation, DMing an admin or moderator, or by using our [contact page](/contact).

## MVPs

- Be consistently among the most helpful members of the server for an extended period of time.
  - We donâ€™t collect metrics on this, but it should be obvious to any active member who deserves this recognition.
- Be humble.

### Above and beyond

- Help the mods direct traffic through the server.
- If a question isn't being answered and may be better suited for a different channel, direct them where to take it.
- If a question has gone unacknowledged, ask for more information.
- Refocus conversations when they get off track.

## Moderators

All of the above, and:

- Enforce the Code of Conduct.
- Participate in moderation discussions.

### Above and beyond

- Contribute to server administration conversations.
- Build and maintain a new part of the community.
- Help with day-to-day administration like the MVP selection schedule

## Admins

All of the above, and:

- Take a proactive role in identifying limitations within the Reactiflux community.
- Contribute to proposals and implementations of changes.
